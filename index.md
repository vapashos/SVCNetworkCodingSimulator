Hi, my name is Pashos Vasileios. 
I am a Computer and Communications Engineer. This is a project regarding my master thesis. Project was relative to a peer to peer algorithm about transmitting an SVC coded video file among several users with proximity to each other using network coding. In this page you can find the source code of the simulator. In any case you can contact me on my personal mail:vapashos@gmail.com
